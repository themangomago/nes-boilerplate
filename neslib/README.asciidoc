Neslib
======

This is a ca65 asm library consisting of useful NES functions. It's designed to be
used with cc65 git master, no need for old runtimes or the like.

Credit for making this goes to Shiru, who published the original in public domain.

However, the original had several bugs and outright bad docs, and Shiru wasn't interested
in making changes to fix those, so here's a fork.

This is under the zlib license.

Sample usage
